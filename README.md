# github-canned-responses

[Note: since GitHub shipped a similar feature for realsies, there's no real point for me to maintain this extension. I've had requests from a couple of people not to nuke this repo since they'd still like to use this, so feel free to continue using it. Or not. It's really up to you. Here's a cactus ðŸŒµ]

Sometimes you've made mistakes and you have to triage 700 GitHub issues and Pull Requests. A lot of them will need the same answer, and your wrists will start hurting from all the switch-to-edit-copy-pasting. This extension helps with that.

## How to get it
[Install it from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-canned-responses/lhehmppafakahahobaibfcomknkhoina)

[Install it from the Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-canned-responses/)

## What is it
The extension adds a little button inside GitHub's
comment editing view, that allows you to choose one of the existing canned responses, and insert it in the current comment. It looks like this, and it works on both Issues and PRs pages (but at the moment not the `files` view of a PR):

## Adding your own canned responses
The extension comes with a few default canned responses, but you can edit them and add your own! In the dropdown, press the edit link, and you'll get something like this:

## Happy triaging, friends! <3
